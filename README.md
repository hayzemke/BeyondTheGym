# BeyondTheGym

Mission Statement:
Create a fitness application where clients are able to connect with their Personal Trainer or Physical Therapist to view their individualized workout plans. They will also be able to communicate with their provider via messaging and set up appointment times to meet with their provider. 

The application will also house all of the client data for the provider where they are able to see the client's current exercise plan, injuries and scheduled appointments. Along with create exercise plans, make changes, and delete them. 


This was my final project for EFA. This project utilizes C#, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. It is a full-stack MVC application with front-end, back end, database structure, and Controller functionality.
